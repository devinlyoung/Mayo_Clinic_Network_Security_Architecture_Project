# Mayo_Clinic_Network_Security_Architecture_Project

This project focuses on using “Cisco Packet Tracer” to design a wide area network and security architecture for “Mayo Clinic” that would mitigate/detect cybersecurity attacks that could happen at each layer of the OSI model and align with the NIST framework (network administration, threat analysis).

In addition, there is a second project that focuses on organizational security within the healthcare industry, using Mayo Clinic as an example.
